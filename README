zerolog - Exposes named pipes as pubsub topics

This software is a proof-of-concept for a network logging daemon. It allows 
to expose local named pipes on the system as PUB-SUB endpoints. 

Clients can 'listen' different pipes by subscribing to relevant topics, 
for example :

ZMQ_SUBSCRIBE, "/tmp/mydaemon.log|"

zerolog itself takes the following options:

 -b Bind the socket (for example: tcp://*:5656)
 -p Pipe to listen to 

Both options can be specified multiple times:

./zerolog -p /tmp/test.pipe -p /tmp/daemon.log -b tcp://*:5656



TODO:

 - Allow specifying directory and listen to all pipes in the dir
 - Files (?)
